# Python Set Operations

Sets in Python are unordered collections of unique elements. They support various operations that allow for efficient manipulation of data. The primary operations include union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference, and subset operations.

## 1. Creating Sets

Sets can be created using curly braces `{}` or the `set()` function.

### Example:

```python
# Creating sets using curly braces
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}

# Creating an empty set
empty_set = set()

print("Set 1:", set1)
print("Set 2:", set2)
print("Empty set:", empty_set)
```

### Output:

```
Set 1: {1, 2, 3, 4}
Set 2: {3, 4, 5, 6}
Empty set: set()
```

## 2. Adding and Removing Elements

Sets allow adding and removing elements with the `add()`, `remove()`, and `discard()` methods.

### Example:

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}

# Adding an element
set1.add(5)
print("After adding 5:", set1)

# Removing an element (raises KeyError if the element is not found)
set1.remove(3)
print("After removing 3:", set1)

# Removing an element (does not raise an error if the element is not found)
set1.discard(10)
print("After discarding 10:", set1)
```

### Output:

```
After adding 5: {1, 2, 4, 5}
After removing 3: {1, 2, 4, 5}
After discarding 10: {1, 2, 4, 5}
```

## 3. Set Operations

Sets support several operations such as union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.

### 3.1 Union

The union of two sets contains all elements from both sets.

### Example:

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}

# Union of set1 and set2
union_set = set1 | set2
print("Union:", union_set)
```

### Output:

```
Union: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
```

### 3.2 Intersection

The intersection of two sets contains only elements that are in both sets.

### Example:

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}

# Intersection of set1 and set2
intersection_set = set1 & set2
print("Intersection:", intersection_set)
```

### Output:

```
Intersection: {3, 4}
```

### 3.3 Difference

The difference between two sets contains elements that are in the first set but not in the second set.

### Example:

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}

# Difference between set1 and set2
difference_set = set1 - set2
print("Difference:", difference_set)
```

### Output:

```
Difference: {1, 2}
```

### 3.4 Symmetric Difference

The symmetric difference of two sets contains elements that are in either set but not in both.

### Example:

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}

# Symmetric difference between set1 and set2
symmetric_difference_set = set1 ^ set2
print("Symmetric Difference:", symmetric_difference_set)
```

### Output:

```
Symmetric Difference: {1, 2, 5, 6}
```

## 4. Subset and Superset Operations

Sets can be checked for subset and superset relationships using `issubset()` and `issuperset()` methods.

### Example:

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Checking if set1 is a subset of set2
print("set1 is a subset of set2:", set1.issubset(set2))

# Checking if set2 is a superset of set1
print("set2 is a superset of set1:", set2.issuperset(set1))
```

### Output:

```
set1 is a subset of set2: True
set2 is a superset of set1: True
```

## 5. Set Comprehensions

Sets can be created using comprehensions, similar to list comprehensions.

### Example:

```python
# Creating a set using set comprehension
squared_numbers = {x**2 for x in range(6)}
print("Squared numbers:", squared_numbers)
```

### Output:

```
Squared numbers: {0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25}
```

## 6. Set Methods

Sets provide several useful methods, including `copy()`, `clear()`, and `pop()`.

### Example:

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}

# Copying a set
set_copy = set1.copy()
print("Copy of set1:", set_copy)

# Clearing a set
set1.clear()
print("After clearing set1:", set1)

# Popping an element (removes and returns an arbitrary element)
set2 = {1, 2, 3}
popped_element = set2.pop()
print("Popped element:", popped_element)
print("After popping:", set2)
```

### Output:

```
Copy of set1: {1, 2, 3, 4}
After clearing set1: set()
Popped element: 1
After popping: {2, 3}
```
