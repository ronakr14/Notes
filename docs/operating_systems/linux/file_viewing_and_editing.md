# Linux File Viewing and Editing Commands

## Overview

Linux provides several commands for viewing and editing files. These commands allow you to read, search, and modify file content from the command line. This document covers basic and commonly used file viewing and editing commands.

## File Viewing Commands

### `cat`

Displays the entire content of a file.

```sh
cat <file>
```

#### Example

```sh
cat file1.txt
# Output: Displays the content of 'file1.txt'
```

### `less`

Displays file content one page at a time. Allows for navigation and searching within the file.

```sh
less <file>
```

#### Example

```sh
less file1.txt
# Output: Displays the content of 'file1.txt' one page at a time
# Use 'q' to quit
```

### `more`

Displays file content one page at a time, similar to `less`, but with fewer features.

```sh
more <file>
```

#### Example

```sh
more file1.txt
# Output: Displays the content of 'file1.txt' one page at a time
# Use 'q' to quit
```

### `head`

Displays the first few lines of a file (default is 10 lines).

```sh
head <file>
```

#### Example

```sh
head file1.txt
# Output: Displays the first 10 lines of 'file1.txt'
```

### `head -n <number> <file>`

Displays the first `<number>` lines of a file.

```sh
head -n <number> <file>
```

#### Example

```sh
head -n 20 file1.txt
# Output: Displays the first 20 lines of 'file1.txt'
```

### `tail`

Displays the last few lines of a file (default is 10 lines).

```sh
tail <file>
```

#### Example

```sh
tail file1.txt
# Output: Displays the last 10 lines of 'file1.txt'
```

### `tail -n <number> <file>`

Displays the last `<number>` lines of a file.

```sh
tail -n <number> <file>
```

#### Example

```sh
tail -n 20 file1.txt
# Output: Displays the last 20 lines of 'file1.txt'
```

### `grep`

Searches for a specific pattern within a file.

```sh
grep "<pattern>" <file>
```

#### Example

```sh
grep "error" log.txt
# Output: Displays lines containing 'error' in 'log.txt'
```

### `find`

Searches for files and directories based on criteria.

```sh
find <path> -name "<filename>"
```

#### Example

```sh
find /home/user/ -name "*.txt"
# Output: Finds all '.txt' files in '/home/user/' directory
```

## File Editing Commands

### `nano`

A simple, user-friendly text editor for the command line.

```sh
nano <file>
```

#### Example

```sh
nano file1.txt
# Opens 'file1.txt' in the nano editor for editing
# Use 'Ctrl + X' to exit, 'Y' to confirm changes, 'N' to discard changes
```

### `vim`

A powerful text editor with a steep learning curve but extensive capabilities.

```sh
vim <file>
```

#### Example

```sh
vim file1.txt
# Opens 'file1.txt' in the vim editor for editing
# Use ':wq' to save and exit, ':q!' to exit without saving
```

### `vi`

An older text editor similar to `vim`, often available by default.

```sh
vi <file>
```

#### Example

```sh
vi file1.txt
# Opens 'file1.txt' in the vi editor for editing
# Use ':wq' to save and exit, ':q!' to exit without saving
```

### `sed`

A stream editor for filtering and transforming text.

```sh
sed 's/<pattern>/<replacement>/' <file>
```

#### Example

```sh
sed 's/oldtext/newtext/' file1.txt
# Replaces 'oldtext' with 'newtext' in 'file1.txt'
```

### `awk`

A programming language for pattern scanning and processing.

```sh
awk '{print $1}' <file>
```

#### Example

```sh
awk '{print $1}' file1.txt
# Prints the first column of 'file1.txt'
```

## Summary

Linux provides a range of commands for viewing and editing files, from simple viewers like `cat` and `less` to powerful editors like `vim` and `nano`. Understanding these commands helps manage and manipulate file content effectively from the command line.
